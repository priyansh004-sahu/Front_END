### Day 3: Interesting Things About CSS

## Understanding Pseudo-Classes & Pseudo-Elements

### What are Pseudo-Classes?

Pseudo-classes allow you to apply styles to elements based on their state or user interaction. They start with a colon `:`.

**Examples:**

---

### What are Pseudo-Elements?

Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element, such as inserting content before or after it. They start with `::`.

**Examples:**

---

## Learning CSS Transitions

### What are Transitions?

CSS transitions allow property changes to occur smoothly over a specified duration instead of happening instantly.

**Example:**

### Transition Properties

- `transition-property`: Defines which property to animate (e.g., color, background, all).
- `transition-duration`: Specifies the time the transition takes (e.g., 0.5s, 1s).
- `transition-timing-function`: Defines the speed curve (`ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`).
- `transition-delay`: Specifies a delay before the transition starts (e.g., 0.2s).

---

## Understanding CSS Transformations

The `transform` property allows you to modify the appearance of an element by moving, rotating, scaling, or skewing it.

### Transform Functions

- `translate(x, y)`: Moves the element.
- `rotate(deg)`: Rotates the element.
- `scale(x, y)`: Enlarges or shrinks the element.
- `skew(x, y)`: Skews the element along the X and Y axis.

**Examples:**

---

## Working with 3D Transformations

3D transformations add depth and perspective to elements, making them appear more dynamic.

### 3D Transform Functions

- `translate3d(x, y, z)`: Moves the element in 3D space.
- `scale3d(x, y, z)`: Scales the element in 3D.
- `rotate3d(x, y, z, angle)`: Rotates the element around a 3D axis.
- `perspective(value)`: Defines the depth effect.

**Examples:**

---

## Understanding CSS Animations

### What are Animations?

CSS animations allow elements to change styles over time without user interaction.

### Animation Properties

- `@keyframes`: Defines the steps of the animation.
- `animation-name`: Specifies the animation name.
- `animation-duration`: Defines how long the animation lasts.
- `animation-timing-function`: Controls the speed curve.
- `animation-iteration-count`: Specifies how many times the animation runs (`infinite`, `1`, `2`, etc.).

**Example:**

## Style Your Form!

### Description

Make your form look good with CSS! Add colors, rounded corners, and make it interactive. Learn to style different parts of the form when someone uses it (like when they hover or click).

### Hints

#### Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`):
- Change how things look when you point at them (hover), click in them (focus), or click on them (active). Think about button colors or input field borders.

#### CSS Transitions:
- Make style changes smooth, not instant. Use `transition` to control how styles change over time.

#### Transforms (2D):
- Move, rotate, or scale things! Try making your button slightly bigger or move a bit when you hover using `transform`.

#### Transforms (3D - Challenge):
- Make things look like they have depth. This is harder! Look at `perspective` and `rotateX` to make elements tilt. *(Optional!)*

#### CSS Animation (Challenge):
- Make things move on their own! Use `@keyframes` to create simple moving effects, like a pulsing button. *(Optional!)*
